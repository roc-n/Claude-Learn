    "reasoning": "The solution successfully meets all three mandatory requirements with clear presentation of daily totals, macronutrient breakdown, and detailed meals with portions and timing. The meal plan is practical and realistic for a marathon athlete. However, the carbohydrate percentage falls marginally short of the 55-65% target range at 52.5%, which represents a minor but measurable deviation from secondary criteria. The plan includes 6 meals rather than the requested 4-5, though this provides better training nutrition coverage. The strategic timing around workouts is well-executed with appropriate pre-, during, and post-workout nutrition."

It exceeds the protein requirement (180g vs 150g minimum) and includes strategic pre/post-workout nutrition. However, it violates the secondary criterion of being 'compact' with 4-5 meals by including 7 eating occasions. The format is well-organized and the nutritional strategy is sound for the stated goal, but the structure deviates from the conciseness requested in the original task description."
