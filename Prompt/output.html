**Notes:** This plan emphasizes carbohydrate loading essential for marathon training, with strategic meal timing around workouts. Post-training meals include both carbs and protein for optimal recovery. All foods are budget-friendly and support endurance performance.</pre></td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution successfully meets all three mandatory requirements with clear presentation of daily totals, macronutrient breakdown, and detailed meals with portions and timing. The meal plan is practical and realistic for a marathon athlete. However, the carbohydrate percentage falls marginally short of the 55-65% target range at 52.5%, which represents a minor but measurable deviation from secondary criteria. The plan includes 6 meals rather than the requested 4-5, though this provides better training nutrition coverage. The strategic timing around workouts is well-executed with appropriate pre-, during, and post-workout nutrition.</td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution successfully meets all three mandatory requirements with clear daily caloric total, detailed macronutrient breakdown, and specific meals with exact portions and times. It exceeds the protein requirement (180g vs 150g minimum) and includes strategic pre/post-workout nutrition. However, it violates the secondary criterion of being 'compact' with 4-5 meals by including 7 eating occasions. The format is well-organized and the nutritional strategy is sound for the stated goal, but the structure deviates from the conciseness requested in the original task description.</td>
